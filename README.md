# <Exploring EJ, Power Plant, and PM2.5 Data Final Project>

## Summary

<This repository contains data and analyses investigating the relationship between coal-burning power plants, PM 2.5 concentrations, and social vulnerability indices (SVI) in North Carolina Counties. This study aims to assess whether areas with higher PM 2.5 levels are correlated with their proximity to coal-burning power plants and if these trends affect communities considered more socially vulnerable as characterized by the CDC. The repository includes cleaned datasets, geospatial analysis outputs, and visualization comparing PM 2.5 levels and SVI across counties.>
